# SingleBranchedGeometryEditor
The web editor enables the quick and clear generation of single-branched geometries that can be shaped in a variety of ways. The generated curves, partial constructions or shapes can be saved and imported later at any time, just like the complete design. The geometry is exported in GLTF format.
